# Frog_16S_Bioinformatics

A self-contained tutorial for the bioinformatics of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, using skin swabs taken from frogs in South Africa. 

**This Folder Contains**
- A .html Markdown file of all code and output, with annotations for each step of the workflow.
- A .Rmd file of the raw code that can be adapted for your own analyses
- Paired End files (2 per sample) from a V3 chemistry Miseq run for 29 frog samples, 1 Negative control, and 1 mock community of known diversity
- A folder 'Taxonomy' conaining the SILVA refernece files for taxonomic assignment, used in this workflow. You may want to download the most up to date version (see below)

**Notes**
Where you see a file path / folder reference, you will need to edit these to reflect the location of the folder on your local machine

This tutorial is adapted from the DADA2 tutorial, which also contains links to the most up to date maintained databases for taxonomy assignment
